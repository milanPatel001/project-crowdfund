# FUNDX - CROWDFUND RAISER SYSTEM

Go To: https://project-crowdfund.vercel.app

## Project Overview

This project is a robust crowdfunding platform that allows users to contribute to individual fundraisers based on their preferences. Whether it's organizations or individuals, this platform serves as a means to garner community support for the causes they believe in.

## Project Architecture

The project follows a server-client model with one central server and multiple clients. The server plays a vital role in communication facilitation and data management, while clients connect to the server to interact with the fundraising platform. Real-time activities such as donations, updates on donation figures, maintenance of donation leaderboards, comments from donors, and notifications to fundraisers are managed through websockets.
